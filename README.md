# [streaming Flask project](https://github.com/sanjayengineer121/video_streaming_sharing_project)

 # Everyone loves to watch their favorite shows with friends and some snacks. But there is something that you might be missing out on!

here is a project will help you all .

- this is open-source project you can use an customize according to needs!

- We already have Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Hotstar but they might get expensive sometimes. So what should we do? You must be wondering that making our own movie website might take time or require some web development knowledge, and after all of that will you still get something really cool?

## âœ… Environment

To use the starter, [Python3](https://www.python.org) should be installed properly in the workstation. If you are not sure if Python is installed, please open a terminal and type `python --version`. Here is the full list with dependencies and tools required to build the app:

- [Python3](https://www.python.org) - the programming language used to code the app
- [GIT](https://git-scm.com) - used to clone the source code from the Github repository
- Basic development tools (g++ compiler, python development libraries ..etc) used by Python to compile the app dependencies in your environment.
- (Optional) `Docker` - a popular virtualization software
<br />


Visit `http://localhost:5085` in your browser. The app should be up & running.


## âœ… Create `.env` file

The meaning of each variable can be found below: 

- `DEBUG`: if `True` the app runs in develoment mode
  - For production value `False` should be used
- `ASSETS_ROOT`: used in assets management
  - default value: `/static/assets`
- `OAuth` via Github
  - `GITHUB_ID`=<GITHUB_ID_HERE>
  - `GITHUB_SECRET`=<GITHUB_SECRET_HERE> 


## âœ… Manual Build

> Download the code 

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/app-generator/flask-volt-dashboard.git
$ cd flask-volt-dashboard
```

<br />

### ðŸ‘‰ Set Up for `Unix`, `MacOS` 

> Install modules via `VENV`  

```bash
$ virtualenv env
$ source env/bin/activate
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

<br />

> Set Up Flask Environment

```bash
$ export FLASK_APP=run.py
$ export FLASK_ENV=development
```

<br />

> Start the app

```bash
$ flask run
// OR
$ flask run --cert=adhoc # For HTTPS server
```

At this point, the app runs at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`. 

<br />

### ðŸ‘‰ Set Up for `Windows` 

> Install modules via `VENV` (windows) 

```
$ virtualenv env
$ .\env\Scripts\activate
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

<br />

> Set Up Flask Environment

```bash
$ # CMD 
$ set FLASK_APP=run.py
$ set FLASK_ENV=development
$
$ # Powershell
$ $env:FLASK_APP = ".\run.py"
$ $env:FLASK_ENV = "development"
```

<br />

> Start the app

```bash
$ flask run
// OR
$ flask run --cert=adhoc # For HTTPS server
```

At this point, the app runs at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`. 

<br />

### ðŸ‘‰ Create Users

By default, the app redirects guest users to authenticate. In order to access the private pages, follow this set up: 

- Start the app via `flask run`
- Access the `registration` page and create a new user:
  - `http://127.0.0.1:5000/register`
- Access the `sign in` page and authenticate
  - `http://127.0.0.1:5000/login`

## âœ… Codebase

The project is coded using blueprints, app factory pattern, dual configuration profile (development and production) and an intuitive structure presented bellow:
